        // step79: so using the deletion code we used in deletePassword function , we delete that form.id first  below ; where we sent the form.id as the "id" to be deleted in the delete function there in DELETE API of the Backend server there.

        // step81: also we can assign it like "let deleteRes" and not "let res" as its already being used in this funciton for the POST request below it ; so we may or may not do "let deleteRes" here : If we don’t need to check response, we can skip assigning; otherwise assign and handle errors like we did earlier in server4.js commented there to do like "if(!deleteRes.ok)" and all : ITS OPTIONAL.
        await fetch("http://localhost:3000/" , {method:"DELETE" , headers :{"Content-Type" : "application/json"} , body : JSON.stringify( {id : form.id}) })

        // step80: after that when we click on save , the code of normal save happens and the editted password gets added there : SO OUR NEW UPADATED PASSWORD GETS ADDED AS A NEW FRESH ENTRY IN THE TABLE , AFTER THE PREVIOUS ONE WHOM WE WANTED TO EDIT GOT DELETED BY THE CODE WRITTEN ABOVE.

        // step81: thus we deleted the previous one on clicking edit ; and then saved the update entry as a new row there.

        const newEntry = { ...form, id: uuidv4() };
        const updatedArray = [...passwordArray, newEntry];
        setpasswordArray(updatedArray);

        // step54: now we comment the above lines which was saving the password in the localStorage and instead now try to save the password in our database server using the code below.

        // step55: so we now send a POST request to the server as we want to submit data to the server now.

        // step56: then we need to tell the server that the data is JSON : so need to give the below header as usual : Without this header, the server might not understand how to parse the incoming data properly.

        // step57: the body below is the actual data sent to the server in the POST request ; { ...form, id: uuidv4() } means : we create a new object with all the current properties in it like : site , username , password & then we append a unique id at end of it.

        // step58: JSON.stringify was done because : we cannot send objects in HTTP requests , but a string only ; and later seeing the header below , the server's body-parser parses it back to JSON to send in the req.body there.

        // step59: so what happens here is that : the POST API made in backend had code : const password = req.body;  Express parses JSON body automatically (with body-parser) & then using the code there : const findResult = await collection.insertOne(password); Inserts the password object into MongoDB database & then the server sends back the response of success: true and all written in the POST API in the backend folder there.
        let res = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/" , {method:"POST" , headers :{"Content-Type" : "application/json"} , body : JSON.stringify({...form , id : uuidv4() }) })

        // setpasswordArray(updatedArray);

        // step75: so now we commented the above code and wrote a new code below -

        // step76: so we are using the below code to tell that : whenever our EDIT button is clicked : we are setting the "id" of the form to the "id" if the password that we want to edit : so below we are first getting the password object that matched the id of the password , whose "id" we clicked on & since it returns an array of object with that matching one object in it ; but "form" was an object not array of object ; so we need the object from that array of that one object ; which we access using the [0] indexing done below : after that we use "..." to set the form to an object that has the current values in it ; but we appended an id with value equal to the "id" of the password whose edit icon we clicked on ; as we had passed "id" as argument here , which was id of the edit icon we clicked on ; so using setform we updated the form state to be an object with the details of the password clciked on and we set its "id" to the password we clicked on to EDIT : thus we can delete it in the 78th step now ; AS WE WANT TO DELETE THE OLD VALUE JUST AS EDIT CLICKED ; AND WILL LATER SAVE THE UPDATED PASSWORD AS A NEW ENTRY IN THE TABLE THERE WHEN SAVE CLICKED AND THE AS USUAL SAVE_PASSWORD FUNCTION SAVES IT TO THE TABLE THERE NOW.
        setform({...passwordArray.filter(item => item.id === id)[0] , id : id})

        // step77: this done to : Remove the old password from the list (temporarily) like we did in the previous version of the passop too , where we did this to not show the password who we clicked to edit by filtering it out and not displaying it in the passwordArray now there ; but when refreshed comes back there ; so its temporarily happening / done here.
        setpasswordArray(passwordArray.filter(item => item.id !== id))
    }

    // step60: we updated the DELETE API first in server4.js there in backend , so see the next steps there first.
    const deletePassword = async(id) => {
        console.log("Deleting password of id" + id)
        let c = confirm("Are you sure to delete this password ?")

            const updatedArray = passwordArray.filter((item) => item.id !== id)
            setpasswordArray(updatedArray);

            // localStorage.setItem("passwords", JSON.stringify(updatedArray))

            // step72: so we commented the above line of code as now we dont want to use localStorage but mongoDB.

            // step73: we write the same code below as we wrote in savePassword ; but now method: DELETE ; so that it triggers the DELETE API in the backend file now.

            // step74: we have sent only the "id" passed as argument in this function i.e. the id of the form that was geenerated by uuid earlier : and we have also editted the delete API in server4.js file : so it now deletes the document that has this "id" there now.
            let res = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/" , {method:"DELETE" , headers :{"Content-Type" : "application/json"} , body : JSON.stringify( {id}) })
